# Penguins
This is a data science project on penguin species on three different islands. 

The data was collected between the years 2007 and 2009. Three different species i.e. 'Adelie' 'Gentoo' 'Chinstrap' were studied from three different islands, Torgersen, Biscoe and Dream. 

A further analysis showed the following;
  * Body Mass and Flipper Length: There appears to be a positive correlation between body mass and flipper length in penguins.(87%)
  * A negative correlation between flipper length and bill depth was noticed. (-58%)
  * Gentoo penguins tend to have the highest average body mass, followed by Chinstrap penguins, while Adelie penguins have the lowest average body mass.
  * Adelie species tend to have the shortest average bill length, 39 millimeters. 
  * There is a positive correlation between bill length and flipper length in the penguins.
  * Body Mass: Male and female penguins exhibit differences in body mass. In general, male penguins tend to have higher average body mass compared to females.
  * Adelie species survive on all the three islands while Chinstrap and Gentoo were only noticed on Dream and Biscoe islands respectively. 

Furthermore, two machine learning models were made i.e. a classification and linear regression model. Both turned out fairly accurate and usable.
